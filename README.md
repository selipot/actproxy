This set of files constitute the Matlab code necessary to derive altimetry proxies of Agulhas Jet and boundary transports as describe in  Beal, L. M. and S. Elipot, Broadening not strengthening of the Agulhas Current since the early 1990s, Nature, 540, 570573, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature19853

The first code to run is read_alongtrack.m which assembles the altimeter data; the second code to run is transport_sla_regression_vert_102.m

The other .m Matlab files are necessary dependencies. The commercial Matlab toolboxes "signal processing" and "statistics" are necessary, as well as the freely distributed Matlab jLab toolbox written by Jonathan Lilly. Please see http://www.jmlilly.net/jmlsoft.html 

**As of May 2017, this code is untested on any other system than mine**, an Apple Computer with operating system macOS Sierra Version 10.12.5 running Matlab version 9.0.0.341360 (R2016a).

Feel free to contribute to this depository, otherwise please email questions or comments to selipot@rsmas.miami.edu. I will reply within a reasonable amount of time. 

** August 2021: implementing reading alongtrack altimetry from CMEMS (instead of AVISO earlier) to derive the same proxy for subsequent years.
