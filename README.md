This set of files constitute the Matlab code necessary to derive altimetry proxies of Agulhas Jet and boundary transports as describe in  Beal, L. M. and S. Elipot, Broadening not strengthening of the Agulhas Current since the early 1990s, Nature, 540, 570573, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature19853

The first code to run is read_alongtrack.m which assembles the altimeter data; the seond code to run is transport_sla_regression_vert_102.m

The other .m Matlab files are necessary dependencies. The Matlab toolboxes "signal processing" and "statistics" are necessary, as if the freely distributed Matlab jLab toolbox written by Jonathan Lilly. Please see http://www.jmlilly.net/jmlsoft.html 

As of May 2017, this code is untested on any other system than mine, an Apple Computer with operating system macOS Sierra Version 10.12.5 running Matlab version 9.0.0.341360 (R2016a)

Feel free to contribute to this depository, otherwisepPlease email questions or comments to selipot@rsmas.miami.edu. I will reply within a reasonable time.
